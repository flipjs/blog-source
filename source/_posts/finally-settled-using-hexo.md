I have finally settled on using [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) as my static site generator. I tried a few, such as Metalsmith, Docpad, Harp, Wintersmith, Assemble, etc., but Hexo is the best by far, for my needs. Plus, it uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) as default external commenting sytem. Just supply your Disqus username, and that's it, your site has now commenting system!

I didn't like the default theme that came up with Hexo. Fortunately, there are loads of themes available on Github. What you see now is based on [Apollo](http://sanographix.github.io/tumblr/apollo/) theme, designed by [sanographix.net](http://www.sanographix.net/).

Next step is, to migrate my blog into Github. Haven't checked yet how to do it in Hexo though. We'll find out soon.
